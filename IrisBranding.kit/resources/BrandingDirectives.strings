Branding Directives

2016 BroadSoft, Inc.

The branding directives file contains key/value pair content that
describes special branding operations related to content control.
These operations transcend simple content replacement.

The key/value pairs follow Apple's "string" file format:
- Keys are surrounded by double quotes.
- Values are surrounded by double quotes.
- Keys are separated from Values by an equals sign.
- Lines end with a semicolon.
- Comments can be multi-line.  They begin with slash-asterisk, and
  they end with asterisk-slash

Example:

"Key" = "Value";

Application Name Directives

========================================================================

All customers must change the bundle identifier and application name
before the branded version can be summitted to the App Store.
*/

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key: "CFBundleIdentifier"  [REQUIRED]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directive uniquely identifies the application bundle.  Each
distinct app or bundle on the system must have a unique bundle ID.  The
bundle identifier is used in validating the app's signature, and it
must be a match for the provisioning profile used for distribution.
Bundle identifiers are defined on the Apple Developer web site:

https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifiers/bundle/bundleList.action
*/
"CFBundleIdentifier" = "it.ebisu.portal";
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key: "CFBundleName"  [REQUIRED]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directive identifies the short name of the application bundle.
This name should be less than 16 characters long and be suitable for
displaying in the app's navigation bar, menu bars, and Info window.

It is generally recommended that the CFBundleName not contain any
spaces.  If the application names requires spaces, add them to the
CFBundleDisplayName instead (see below).

This key can also be localized by modifying the InfoPlist.strings file
of the appropriate ".lproj" resource subdirectories.
*/
"CFBundleName" = "Ebisu";

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key: "CFBundleDisplayName"  [OPTIONAL]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directive identifies the display name of the application bundle.
It is normal to include this directive, and it is typical that it
matches the CFBundleName;  however, it is not mandatory to include this
directive because the bundle name will be used instead when the display
name is undefined.  When provided, the display name is not required to
match the bundle name, but it would be awkward if there was much
variance.  This name is displayed under the icon, in dialog titles, and
in the settings menu.

If this key is included, and the CFBundleName is localized in the
InfoPlist.strings file for any ".lproj" resource subdirectory, then
this key must also be localized to match.
*/
/* "CFBundleDisplayName" = "Ebisu"; */

/*======================================================================

Version Directives

========================================================================

BroadSoft uses 3 period-separated integers to define the application
version using the following convention:
    <major>.<minor>.<maint>

Where:
    <major> BroadSoft major release number
    <minor> BroadSoft minor release number
    <maint> BroadSoft maintenance release number (normally bug fixes)

Example:  20.0.1

Many customers who rebrand and submit OEM versions to the App Store
prefer to keep a version number that includes the BroadSoft version;
this simplifies support.  However, if a customer needs to submit a
follow-up OEM release of the same BroadSoft binary to the App Store
with updated branding resources, a potential version issue can arise.
Apple requires that each App Store release must increment the version
number from the previous release, but this moves the OEM version out of
alignment with the BroadSoft version.

To help simplify this situation, the branding tools append a branding
version to the app version number.  Unfortunately, Apple is very
strict about the version number formatting, and it cannot have more
than 3 period-separated integers, nor can the numbers contain alpha
characters like hyphens or colons.  Thus it is not possible to simply
append a 4th number.  Instead, the branding version is concatenated with
the maintenance number.  The branding scripts try to make this as easy
as possible, and the user is always prompted on the command line and
given the opportunity to change the numbers.

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key: "BrandingVersion"  [CONDITIONAL]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directive is defined to simplify the process of updating the
application release number for branding.  Simply set the branding
version (a single number), and the branding script will take care of
the rest.  It is customary to begin with 0, but the number can be set
otherwise.  The only requirement is that subsequent releases for the
same branding kit increment the number.

If this key is undefined, the branding version is assumed to be 0
(zero).

NOTE: When branding a new release from BroadSoft, the branding version
should be reset to 0.
*/
"BrandingVersion" = "0.1";

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key: "CFBundleShortVersionString"  [OPTIONAL]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CFBundleShortVersionString is automatically generated by the
branding scripts, but it may be set here.  If included, this number
will used in lieu of a number based on the BroadSoft build number.

If defined, the CFBundleShortVersionString can also be localized in the
InfoPlist.strings file for any ".lproj" resource subdirectory.
*/
/* "CFBundleShortVersionString" = "1.0.0"; */

/*======================================================================

Language Directives

========================================================================

Generally speaking, languages are treated like other content during the
branding process.  Language files that exist in the application can be
overwritten with branded versions.  However, it may also be the case
that marketing requires a new language be added or an existing language
be removed.
*/

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key: "AllowedLanguages" [OPTOINAL]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directive specifies an explicit subset of languages to support
from the the complete set of languages defined for the application.
This list should not contain AddedLanguages (see below).

The value is a comma-separated list language designations (with optional
regional designations).  Refer to Apple's developer documentation for
specifics:

https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/Articles/LanguageDesignations.html

If undefined, all languages defined for the application are allowed.
*/
/* "AllowedLanguages" = "en,de,es,fr,it,ja,ko,nl,zh-Hans"; */

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key: "AddedLanguages"  [OPTOINAL]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directive is needed to specify the set of languages added to the
application.  This is not a typical task, and customers should seek
guidance from BroadSoft branding documentation before making such a
change.

The value is a comma-separated list language designations (with
optional regional designations).  Refer to Apple's developer
documentation for specifics:

https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/Articles/LanguageDesignations.html

Example:
"AddedLanguages" = "bg,ro";
*/

/*======================================================================

URL Scheme Directives

========================================================================

Some BroadSoft apps can be launched by other apps by way of URL Schemes.
For specifics on this topic, refer to Apple's developer documentation:
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html#/apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW1

There are two sides of scheme support:
1) Handling Schemes (i.e. receiving a scheme URL)
2) Using Schemes (i.e. opening a scheme URL)

An application can support either, both, or neither.  For applications
that support scheme handling, it can be disabled here.
*/

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key: "EnableBundleURLSchemeHandling"  [OPTIONAL]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scheme handling for the app can be completely disabled by setting the
EnableBundleURLSchemeHandling option to NO (case insensitive).  The
default/assumed value is YES.
*/
/* "EnableBundleURLSchemeHandling" = "YES"; */

/*======================================================================

Associated Domains Directives

========================================================================

Applications can be associated to specific web domains to allow extra
features such as access to shared web credentials. By default Applications
are not associated to any domain.
*/

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key: "WebCredentialsAssociatedDomains" [OPTOINAL]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directive specifies an explicit set of domains the application
is associated to. Specifying a domain (or list of domains) will cause
the iOS device operating system to fetch a JSON file with a specific name and
path in such domain(s) and will check for match of this applicaiton with the
application(s) listed in the fetched file. Only when a successful match happens
the association is completed and the Password Autofill features such as
offering credentils automatic storage upon login or generation of strong
passwords in Update Password screen will be offered by the application.

For more details consult:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/about_the_password_autofill_workflow
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/setting_up_an_app_s_associated_domains

The value is a comma-separated list of domains. You can specify one or several
(or none) domains. The branding scripts take these domains and prefixes them
with the "webcredentials:" service string before they are added to the
application entitlements during signing.

The domain association entitlement has to be enabled in the application
profle for this domains to be used.
If undefined, the application will not have a domain to associate with the
features mentioned above will be disabled.
*/

/* "WebCredentialsAssociatedDomains" = "example.com,example2.com"; */

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Key: "AllowedExtensions" [OPTIONAL]
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Application extensions can be removed by setting the AllowedExtensions
 with the list of supported extensions in comma separated values. App
 extensions not mentioned in the attribute will be removed. If this attribute
 is not specified all the app extensions are retained.
 */
 /* "AllowedExtensions" = "IrisWidget"; */

/*Note: For Removing all the App extensions the value has to be set to

"AllowedExtensions" = "[]";
*/

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Key: "DisableDarkMode"  [OPTIONAL]
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To disable dark mode, the attribute can be configured as follows:
 "DisableDarkMode" = "true";
 */

 /*----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Key: "DisableCrashLogging"  [OPTIONAL]
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  To disable crash logging, the attribute can be configured as follows:
  "DisableCrashLogging" = "true";
  */
